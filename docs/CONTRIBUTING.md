## Getting Started

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the
project, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments)
. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a [new issue](https://github.com/HawAPI/HawAPI/issues).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/HawAPI/HawAPI/issues) to find one that interests you. You can
narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an
issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

- Using GitHub Desktop:

  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)
    will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it
    to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository)
    so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Install **NPM or Yarn** and **IntelliJ IDEA/Eclipse/NetBeans/VsCode** and Check out [how to request](./REQUESTTING.md)

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Don't forget
  to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
  if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox
  to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
  so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, a member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either
  using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
  or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in
  your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation
  as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations)
  .
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to
  help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Congratulations, your PR is merged!

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [HawAPI](https://hawapi.theproject.id/api).

Now that you are part of the **HawAPI Community**.
